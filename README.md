# Parallel Programming using MPI Interface

This projectâ€™s aim is to simulate parallel programming interface for relief algorithm. In this project I implement an algorithm called relief with MPI interface. With the help of MPI interface I will be simulating multiple processor environment working parallel to solve relief algorithm as fast as possible.
